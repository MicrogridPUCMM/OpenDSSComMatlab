# OpenDSS Matlab COM Interface for Fault Identification
## Modelling of local utility circuit in Dominican Republic

This repository presents the application of OpenDSS and MATLAB for the simulation of synthetical faults identification
on a real circuit simulation based in Dominican Republic, Santiago City. For information on the construction of the 
circuit simulation visit:

## Features

- Application of OpenDSS COM interface with MATLAB for the extraction of power flow results
- Syntethical fault data set created using random load profile
- Application of crossvalidation for the training process of decision trees for fault identification
- GIS information integration for the automatic generation of OpenDSS simulation scripts
